## Preface

My reading time shot up ever since I came home to India in March. And I decided to review all the books I read, because:
- I don't remember most of the books I read as a child (and I read a ton back then); sitting down to think and write about them might help with the retention.
- And perhaps all this writing would be good practice for my research career.

So here's an ever-updating list of books I've read and reviewed, currently sorted in descending order of when I finished them. I've included a short blurb as to _why_ I read each book. All ratings out of five.

- **Children of Time**, Adrian Tchaikovsky
  - My rating: 5 stars

  - Adrian Tchaikovsky makes you roots for a bunch of spiders. Who are sentient. Yeah... An incredible sci-fi gala of epic proportions!

- **The Secret Garden**, Frances Hodgson Burnett
  - My rating: 4 stars
  - Medium: [Audiobook](https://open.spotify.com/album/0RO7W1kUubsia0zZi3Xnke?si=W7JnFt6qR-GZJqw9rx7tfg&dl_branch=1)

  - Medium: Kindle
  - I read this as part of [r/books' July reading](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/o0cgsf/the_rbooks_book_club_selection_for_july_is/). Never has an exploratory action resulted in such a high reward.
  - Review: [My full review on Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4092842841)

- **Pride and Prejudice**, Jane Austen
  - My rating: 3 stars
  - Medium: [Audiobook](https://open.spotify.com/show/3EF8i5P1bmQMc7oXEWW4bo?si=ebDmd5qmQ0uTz5DiyAKo9g&dl_branch=1)
  - Amusing to see though that the same kind of worries about men, women, and marriage transcend cultures and centuries. Loved the old English.

- **The Murder of Roger Ackroyd**, Agatha Christie

- **The Time Traveler's Wife**, Audrey Niffenegger
  - My rating: 4 stars
  - Medium: Kindle
  - What if you met a person who knew almost all about how your life will unfold. How do you live with the knowledge of future, good and bad? A fun, heavy, thought-provoking book.
  - Review: [My full review on Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2464823178)

- **Hominids**, Robert Sawyer
  - My rating: 4 stars
  - Medium: Kindle
  - I really enjoy this genre of "education through fiction." Full marks to the science and ideas introduced in this book — Sawyer does an excellent job at that as usual. The encapsulating fictional storyline was primarily engaging but at times jarringly poor.
  - Review: [My full review on Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4013357673)

- **Sapiens**, Yuval Noah Harari
  - My rating: 5 stars
  - Medium: Audiobook
  - YNH traces the history of ideas — language, religion, money, agriculture, capitalism, and so on — and how these ideas, in turn, affected our culture and development. A fantastic read.
  - Review: [My full review on Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4145846288)

- **Crime and Punishment**, Fyodor Dostoyevsky
  - My rating: 4 starts
  - Medium: Audiobook
  - What does on inside the head of someone who commits a crime. Before, during, and afterwards. Engrossing prose and intricate character development.
  - Review: [My full review on Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3896526021)

- **The Haunting of Hill House**, Shirley Jackson
  - My rating: 3 stars
  - Medium: Kindle
  - Tense, but not scary. I am hearing good things about the Netflix show, though.
  - Review: [My full review on Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4008452096)

- **12 Rules for Life**, Jordan Peterson
  - My rating: 4 stars
  - Medium: Kindle
  - Makes you uncomfortable. Makes you think. Makes you learn.
  - Review: [My full review on Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3991412593)

- **Fahrenheit 451**, Ray Bradbury
  - My rating: 4 stars
  - Medium: Kindle
  - A thought-provoking plot, not the best execution. I wish Black Mirror adapts this script.
  - Review: [My full review on Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3659594497)

- **Calculating God**, Robert Sawyer
  - My rating: 4 stars
  - Medium: Kindle
  - Whichever side of the creationist debate you are on, this book is a fun ride; the author presents both sides of the arguments quite earnestly, with only subtle shades of bias. Robert Sawyer is a master of introducing thought-provokiong ideas through fiction.
  - Review: [My full review on Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3739539728)

- **Eaters of the Dead**, Michael Crichton
  - My rating: 4 stars
  - Medium: Kindle

- **A Thousand Brains**, Jeff Hawkins
  - My rating: 5 stars

- **The Three-Body Problem**, Cixian Liu
  - My rating: 3 stars
  - Medium: Kindle
  - Incredible premise tainted by poor execution. I wish someone does justice to it with a TV show adaptation.
  - Review: [My full review on Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3555404356)

- **Sphere**, Michael Crichton
  - My rating: 4 stars
  - Medium: Kindle
  - Another book with an incredible premise with a story that almost delivers but leaves you wanting for more.
  - Review: [My full review on Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1837134388)

- **The Invisible Man**, H.G. Wells
  - My rating: 3 stars
  - Medium: Audiobook
  - Another sci-fi classic: a mad scientist discovers invisibility but fails to undo it. Might have been a hit when it was published, had a lot more untapped potential IMO.
  - Review: [My full review on Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3867395429)

- **The Time Machine**, H.G. Wells
  - My rating: 3 stars
  - Medium: Audiobook
  - One of the most influential sci-fi authors predicts what the future of humanity could look like based on 19th-century society.
  - Review: [My full review on Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1244635509)

- **Flowers of Algernon**, Daniel Keyes
  - My rating: 4 stars
  - Medium: Kindle
  - Heavy stuff. A mentally-deficient man undergoes an experimental procedure to increase his intellectual capabilities, and us readers go through the journey from his point-of-view via his diary entries. And of course the procedure wasn't so perfect after all...
  - Review: [My full review on Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1706001932)

- **Animal Farm**, George Orwell
  - My rating: 4 stars
  - Medium: [Audiobook](https://open.spotify.com/artist/1TyZ2vOH3Xyk3Kd8aGaoyl?si=Ys9338RDTQ2uQe7_xLjtGw&dl_branch=1)
  - George Orwell creates a wonderful allegorical drama to showcase how noble intents can devolve into brutal totalitarian regimes in no time. Eerie how relevant the book is ever since it was written in 1945.

<!-- - **Invisible Women**, Caroline Criado Pérez
  - My rating: 4 stars
