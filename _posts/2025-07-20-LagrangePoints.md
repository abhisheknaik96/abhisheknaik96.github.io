## Preface

Intimidating name, unintuitive phenomena, but it all makes sense after a while.

## Background

Let's define:
- $$m_s$$: mass of the Sun
- $$m_e$$: mass of Earth<sup>1<sup>
- $$G$$: the Gravitational constant
- $$R$$: average distance between the Sun and Earth. For simplicity, we assume that Earth's orbit around the Sun is circular.

Now, the gravitational force of the Sun on a satellite at a distance $$r$$ from Earth: $$F_s = \frac{G m_s m_e}{(R-r)^2}$$.
