Hello, world. <br>

We can all agree that the internet has become an indispensable part of our lives. It's fun to see how much socializing takes place here in the hostels when there is an power outage.  

So here's a non-exhaustive list of utilities and hacks I use to make my internet/laptop experience just that tad easier and better.  

<br>

1.	[convert2mp3](http://convert2mp3.net/en/)  

	Rip out video and/or audio from popular video platforms like YouTube and Dailymotion in a wide variety of formats. What makes this particular service stand out among the plethora of others doing the same thing - it preserves the metadata, which can be edited before downloading! As a music afiando, I like my music organized, and this it painful to do later in Ubuntu.

2.	[TwitterRipper](http://www.downloadtwittervideo.com/TwitterGif.php)

	Lets you rip gifs and videos from tweets in gif/mp4/mp3 formats.

3. 	[YouTube Copier](https://ctrlq.org/youtube/playlists/)

	Imagine a scenario when YouTube comes up with this amazing mix for you and you know that a random seed is never gonna give you that beautiful collection of soulful music ever again. What do you do? Use this tool to save this mix as one of your personal YouTube playlists. You're welcome.

4.	[Audio Editor](http://audiojoiner.com/audio_join.php)

	Cut, join, convert audio for free. 'Nuff said.

5. 	[PDF compresser](https://www.ilovepdf.com/compress_pdf)

	Downsize all of those image-heavy projects into respectable sizes for sending and uploading.

6.	[ThrowAwayMail](http://www.throwawaymail.com/en)

	To create accounts for all those pesky websites which require you to sign up before accessing the content. USPs - Lasts for 48 hours, not 10 or 20 minutes.

7.	[Android APKs](https://oceanofapk.com/)

	To get most of those paid apps for free.

8.	Free eBooks - [here](https://ebook.bike/search/) and [here](https://www.gutenberg.org/).

	ePubs or Kindle versions (if you're lucky).

9.	[ASoftMurmur](https://asoftmurmur.com/)

	Contrallable ambient sounds to wash away distraction. My favourite is a mix of splattering rain, howling wind, and crashing waves.

10.	[TotalSportek](http://www.totalsportek.com/)

	Watch all sports online. Might require more than a few clicks to find a working link. For La Liga et al., use `hotstar` for free, live, legit streaming.

11. [Markdown Live Preview](http://markdownlivepreview.com/)

	Self-explanatory. 

<br>

Bored for now. Will add more soon.

2 No, I don't have Tamil origins. So why do I call her that, and my sister *Akka*? Well, long story, let's keep that for another time...
