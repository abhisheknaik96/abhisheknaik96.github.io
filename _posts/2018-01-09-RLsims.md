Hello, world. <br>

Here's where I'll collect some of the AI advances that catch my eye. As you'll notice, the main focus will be on advances of Reinforcement Learning in the self-driving space.    

There's a large bunch of items that I've to add to this list from the scatter of places I've collected them (mainly through [my tweets](https://twitter.com/anaik96), after being momentarily blown away on hearing/reading about it for the first time).   

In case you find anything fascinating, feel free to ping me for some interesting discussions.

- 12/1/2018 : [Mobileye's Responsibility Sensitive Safety](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ_uGvHlLr4)    
	Mobileye finally has a product out of [its remarkable paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.03295) on safety for autonomous vehicles. This RSS module can do things like calculate the minimum safe distance to cut into a lane based on the speeds of the vehicles involved, etc. It would be interesting to try out this RSS module in some of the FAD research.    

- 9/1/2018 : [MuJoCo plug-in for Unity](http://www.mujoco.org/book/unity.html)   
	MuJoCo physics + Unity graphics = Awesome robotic simulators!

- 8/1/2018 : [NVIDIA's AutoSIM VR simulator](https://www.vrfocus.com/2018/01/nvidia-aids-the-development-of-self-driving-cars-with-the-autosim-vr-simulator/)   
	Yet another driving simulator, this time from NVIDIA. Seems to be highly customizable - 'moving the sun to test a self-driving car's sensors with shadows or direct glare off the road'.

- 19/12/2017 : [Intel AI's RL Coach](https://ai.intel.com/reinforcement-learning-coach-carla-qr-dqn/)   
	Is now equipped with basic imitation learning algorithms, CARLA, and new algorithms like QR-DQN.

- 20/11/2017 : A bunch of new announcements!    
	1. [GTA-V](https://github.com/ai-tor/DeepGTAV) Dev is out!   
	2. [Microsoft AirSim for Cars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnz1X3UNM5Y) is out! 
	3. [CARLA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hp8Dz-Zek2E) for Linux is also out!    
	    
	Exciting times ahead for autonomous driving researcher! :D
