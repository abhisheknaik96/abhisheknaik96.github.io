summary : A collection of AI advances, as and when they come along.
---

Hello, world. <br>

Here's where I'll collect some of the AI advances that catch my eye. As you'll notice, the main focus will be on advances of Reinforcement Learning in the self-driving space.    

There's a large bunch of items that I've to add to this list from the scatter of places I've collected them (mainly through [my tweets](https://twitter.com/anaik96), after being momentarily blown away on hearing/reading about it for the first time).   

In case you find anything fascinating, feel free to ping me for some interesting discussions.

- 21/1/2018 : [GPUs now available on Colaboratory!](https://www.kaggle.com/getting-started/47096#post271139)    
	This is unbelievable. Google is letting people use GPUs in Colaboratory! K80s for now, TPUs next? Let's see how long this last before folks (especially miners) exploit the crap out of this...   

- 12/1/2018 : [Mobileye's Responsibility Sensitive Safety](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eQ_uGvHlLr4)    
	Mobileye finally has a product out of [its remarkable paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.03295) on safety for autonomous vehicles. This RSS module can do things like calculate the minimum safe distance to cut into a lane based on the speeds of the vehicles involved, etc. It would be interesting to try out this RSS module in some of the FAD research.    

- 9/1/2018 : [MuJoCo plug-in for Unity](http://www.mujoco.org/book/unity.html)   
	MuJoCo physics + Unity graphics = Awesome robotic simulators!

- 8/1/2018 : [NVIDIA's AutoSIM VR simulator](https://www.vrfocus.com/2018/01/nvidia-aids-the-development-of-self-driving-cars-with-the-autosim-vr-simulator/)   
	Yet another driving simulator, this time from NVIDIA. Seems to be highly customizable - 'moving the sun to test a self-driving car's sensors with shadows or direct glare off the road'.

- 19/12/2017 : [Intel AI's RL Coach](https://ai.intel.com/reinforcement-learning-coach-carla-qr-dqn/)   
	Is now equipped with basic imitation learning algorithms, CARLA, and new algorithms like QR-DQN.

- 20/11/2017 : A bunch of new announcements!    
	1. [GTA-V](https://github.com/ai-tor/DeepGTAV) Dev is out!   
	2. [Microsoft AirSim for Cars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnz1X3UNM5Y) is out! 
	3. [CARLA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hp8Dz-Zek2E) for Linux is also out!    
	    
	Exciting times ahead for autonomous driving researcher! :D
