So an Uber in the autonomous mode [killed a woman](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/technology/uber-driverless-fatality.html) crossing a street a few hours ago, _while there was a human safety driver at the wheel_.     
The first things that come to mind:
- Assuming the woman wasn't jaywalking, at what speed was the Uber crossing the intersection anyway to kill her.
- Secondly, what was the 'safety human driver' doing? Isn't his/her job description to precisely do this one thing of not bumping the car into anyone or anything?!    

Oh well, let's wait for Uber to make a statement about the technical details. It might take a while because they'll want to be 101% sure of what they're reporting, since their, and pretty much all the autonomous driving players' necks hang in balance now...

_Update (22/3/18)_    

So the interior and exterior camera footage [was released](http://www.foxnews.com/us/2018/03/22/dashcam-video-deadly-self-driving-uber-crash-released.html) by the Tempe Police Department. Thoughts:
- IMHO, it would have been extremely difficult for a human driver to avoid that accident, with the low visibility compounded by the jaywalking. But aren't such kinds of situations exactly where autonomous vehicles supposed to perform better than humans, with their armory of sensors for a richer-than-human sensory input? :/
- Secondly, why release such disturbing footage to the general public during an ongoing investigation? It would have been better had they released this a few days later with a juxtaposedcommentary or annotation on what exactly was going on and what went wrong...   

Anyway, I'm really interested to know how the LiDAR/RADAR input was being handled by the Uber inm the seconds leading to the crash...
