So an Uber in the autonomous mode [killed a woman](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/technology/uber-driverless-fatality.html) crossing a street a few hours ago, _while there was a human safety driver at the wheel_.     
The first things that come to mind:
- Assuming the woman wasn't jaywalking, at what speed was the Uber crossing the intersection anyway to kill her.
- Secondly, what was the 'safety human driver' doing? Isn't his/her job description to precisely do this one thing of not bumping the car into anyone or anything?!    

Oh well, let's wait for Uber to make a statement about the technical details. It might take a while because they'll want to be 101% sure of what they're reporting, since their, and pretty much all the autonomous driving players' necks hang in balance now...
