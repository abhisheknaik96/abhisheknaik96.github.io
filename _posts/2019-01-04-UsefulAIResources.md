So here's a collection of great resources that _I have used_ for learning/reviewing concepts of AI. I'll keep updating the list as and when I come across more material that I would like to recommend.

### Maths for Machine Learning 

- Matrix Calculus [[Link](https://atmos.washington.edu/~dennis/MatrixCalculus.pdf)]
	- Concise notes covering useful identities along with their proofs.
- General ML Maths [[Link](https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~mpd37/teaching/2017/496/notes.pdf)]
	- 130 pages of a high-level overview, not meant for teaching/learning purposes.

### Reinforcement Learning

- The RL textbook [[Link](http://www.incompleteideas.net/book/RLbook2018.pdf)]
	- Brilliantly-written, provides a gentle and general introduction to RL. 
- Code for the RL textbook [[Python](https://github.com/ShangtongZhang/reinforcement-learning-an-introduction); [Jupyter Notebooks](https://marcinbogdanski.github.io/ai_sketchpad/)]
	- Python and iPython versions of codes for generating (almost all) the figures and graphs in the RL textbook.
- David Silver's course [[Slides](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/d.silver/web/Teaching.html)]
	- Would recommend reading alongside or after the RL textbook.
- Olivier Sigaud's course [[Videos and slides](http://pages.isir.upmc.fr/~sigaud/teach/)]
	- Would also recommend alongside the textbook for cementing concepts intutively.

### General

- A* [[Link](https://www.redblobgames.com/pathfinding/a-star/introduction.html)]
	- Concise theory accompanied by brilliant, interactive animations.
