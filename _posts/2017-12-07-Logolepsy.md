Hello, world. <br>

Not long ago, Nike the torpe succumbed to throes of love. Left for dead, he became engulfed in drapetomania, which led to a phase wherein all he wanted to achieve was being unfuckwithable. A plethora of things needing overhaul were identified, and soon gymming and lisztomania took over. But though he spent days and weeks induratizing, it wasnâ€™t long before he longed for the elusive redamancy yet again. Fate led him to this amazing librocubicularist, who unveiled a window to a world he never knew existed. Idiosyncrasies like vellichor brought them closer and things like life pulled them apart. The scripturient demisexual was inundated by the vorfreude he seeked solace in - savouring the roar of waves and the soft sirimiri while cafuning in front of a warm hearth, following the satiation of the basorexia. And thus the newfound logolepsy<sup>^</sup> was put to test.
