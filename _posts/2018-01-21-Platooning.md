Just realized that platooning, something I first heard in Tesla's semi-truck launch, was first implemented in/by UC Berkeley *[back in 1991](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~varaiya/papers_ps.dir/SmartCars.pdf)*. Yes, autonomous platooning, wherein  vehicles travel at highway speeds with small inter-vehicle spacing to reduce congestion and still achieve high throughput without compromising on safety. This is a really attractive concept as it demonstrates improved efficiencies with relatively little change to the vehicles.    
Now that one thinks of it, it seems obvious that autonomous cars in (the near) future will communicate, cooperate, and form platoons over intersecting lengths of their commutes.
