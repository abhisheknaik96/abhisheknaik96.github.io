## [About Me](#about-me)

I just finished my Ph.D. at the University of Alberta with [Richard Sutton](http://incompleteideas.net/), in which I developed simple and practical algorithms from first principles for long-lived artificial decision-making systems.

In particular, I developed algorithms within the reinforcement-learning framework for continuing (non-episodic) problems—in which the agent-environment interaction goes on _ad infinitum_—with the goal of maximizing the average reward obtained per step. Empirically, the algorithms are easy to implement and use.

<!-- I just finished my Ph.D. at the University of Alberta, working with Professor [Rich Sutton](incompleteideas.net/) in the Reinforcement Learning and Artificial Intelligence ([RLAI](http://rlai.ualberta.ca/)) lab.
I am fascinated by the question of how the mind works and how we can build artificial systems that have general learning abilities.
I believe reinforcement learning offers _the_ computational theory of intelligence and I am trying to discover how agents can continually learn to perform a myriad of tasks over their lifetime! -->

I love space! And I want to use my AI expertise in space sciences and technology.
I envision a future where artificial systems will have human-like intelligence and adaptability, making space exploration significantly easier and safer for our species.
<!-- The effort has to be inter-disciplinary, so come join [the greatest intellectual pursuits of our time](https://twitter.com/richardssutton/status/1575619651563708418)! -->

<!-- The extent to which this pursuit will advance science and benefit humanity make it one of the greatest intellectual pursuits of our time. -->

<!-- I want to discover the general principles that underlie goal-seeking behaviour. I study how the mind works and how intelligent systems can continually learn to perform a myriad of tasks over their lifetime. I believe research progress in these areas will benefit humanity significantly and tangibly, for good. -->
<!-- Currently, my research focuses on learning and planning methods for continuing (non-episodic) problems. I also love reading about the connections between AI, neuroscience, and cognitive psychology. -->
<!-- I think about intelligence in the context of artificial agents and conduct research in fundamental RL for making it better-suited for solving real-world problems. I hope to make autonomous vehicles a reality in my country, India. -->

## [Master's Thesis](#mtech)

_This thesis was a part of my integrated Bachelor's + Master's program in the Dept. of Computer Science and Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology Madras in Chennai, India, supervised by Professor [Balaraman Ravindran](www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~ravi). Defended in **May 2018**._

My goal was to make self-driving cars a reality in my country, India. Towards this end, I modeled it as a multi-agent learning problem in a safety-critical application and:
1. proposed a risk-averse imitation learning algorithm that had lower tail-end risk w.r.t. the then state-of-the-art,
2. trialled a curriculum-based learning approach for multi-agent RoboSoccer, and
3. extended the TORCS simulator to release the first open-source driving simulator that supports multi-agent training —  MADRaS (has 100+ stars on [Github](https://github.com/abhisheknaik96/MultiAgentTORCS)).

## [Interests and Hobbies](#interests-and-hobbies)

### Ice-hockey
One of the fastest sport in the world, with an exhausting 60 minutes of action (yes, even while watching). The wizardry these athletes pull off _while on skates_ is a delight to watch (shoutout to Connor McDavid! _#LetsGoOilers_). I am currently ~~learning ice-skating in order to start playing ice-hockey by early 2020!~~ ~~learning to play ice-hockey!~~ playing hockey in a league!

### Formula 1
There's hardly anything as spectacular as this confluence of science and engineering which gives the world these lean, mean, and beautiful machines, with some of fittest athletes on the planet battling fearlessly at speeds excessive of 300 kmph over 20+ challenging tracks all over the world. Current favorite track: Spa Francorchamps, Team: _Forza Ferrari_ forever!

<!-- ### Football
I love watching and playing _the beautiful game_. Come rain or shine, my heart beats for Real Madrid. I also root for Liverpool, Juventus, and Portugal. My favorite player is, you guessed it, Cristiano Ronaldo --- one of the greatest footballers of all time. -->

### Books
If I had to pick one ~~thing~~ of the few things I could do all my life, it would be reading (sports comes first). With three fat bookshelves overflowing with books back home, and many more in my handy Kindle, there are actually times when I am happy to see long queues, presenting another opportunity to dive into my latest book. Some of my favorite authors are Adrian Tchaikovsky, Ted Chiang, Andy Weir, Michael Crichton. I also read non-fiction, mostly about intelligence. Check out [my Goodreads page](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/41821528-abhishek-naik)!

### Space
I've found space fascinating since I was a kid. Over the past few years, my go-to sci-fi subgenre is first contact and inter-galactical travel. But my interest in space has had a massive resurgence thanks to [Kerbal Space Program](https://www.kerbalspaceprogram.com/) and [Everyday Astronaut](https://www.youtube.com/c/EverydayAstronaut/videos). Instead of core AI, I ~might~ want to start a career in Space x AI.

<!-- ### Music
During the pandemic, I have started learning to play the piano. I hope to play my favourite piano piece [Nuvole Bianche](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUCI-1vIbUo) by the end of 2020! -->
<!-- Beats. Bass. Boisterous. Be it working or working out, music is my constant companion.  Imagine Dragons, Linkin Park, The Script, Zedd, Alan Walker, Bastille, Fall Out Boy, Green Day rule the playlist of this renowned bathroom singer. I also tune into old classics once in a while. I wish to make my own remixes someday. -->

<!-- ### Age of Empires
I grew up building many civilisations and plotting the downfall of others, all the while learning so much about the intriguing medieval history. With countless hours spent on AoE2's gripping storyline and exciting gameplay, I can't wait for [AOE4](https://www.ageofempires.com/games/age-of-empires-iv/) to come out! -->

### Photography and Traveling
I love visiting and documenting quaint, spectacular places, and digging into the local cuisine. Till I figure out where to showcase some of my favorite pictures, here is my [old Flickr account](https://www.flickr.com/photos/120844874@N04/). I also enjoy trekking and hiking into the wilderness. After skydiving, bungee jumping, scuba diving, parasailing, I'm looking forward to hang gliding and cliff jumping!
