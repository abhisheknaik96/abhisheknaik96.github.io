# [About Me](#about-me)

Hello World!

I am a Ph.D. student with the [Reinforcement Learning and Artificial Intelligence (RLAI) group](http://rlai.ualberta.ca/) at the [University of Alberta](https://www.ualberta.ca/), working with [Professor Rich Sutton](http://incompleteideas.net/). I think about intelligence in the context of artificial agents and conduct research in fundamental RL for making it better-suited for solving real-world problems. I hope to make autonomous vehicles a reality in my country, India.

<!-- I am a final year undergraduate student at [IIT Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in), pursuing a Dual Degree (B.Tech + M.Tech) in the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.cse.iitm.ac.in). I am interested in tackling challenging and practical problems in the broad areas of Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning, under the guidance of [Professor Balaraman Ravindran](https://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~ravi). -->
