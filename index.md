# [About Me](#about-me) 

Hello World! I am a final year undergraduate student at [IIT Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in), pursuing a Dual Degree (B.Tech + M.Tech) in the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.cse.iitm.ac.in). I am interested in tackling challenging and practical problems in the broad areas of Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning, under the guidance of [Professor Balaraman Ravindran](https://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~ravi).
