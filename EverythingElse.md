# [Interests and Hobbies](#everythingElse)

## Sports

### Ice-hockey
One of the fastest sport in the world, with exhausting 60 minutes of action (yes, even while watching). The wizardry these athletes pull off _while on ice-skates_ is a delight to watch  (shoutout to Connor McDavid! _#LetsGoOilers_). I am currently learning ice-skating in order to start playing ice-hockey by early 2020!

### Formula 1
There's hardly anything as spectacular as this confluence of science and engineering which gives the world these lean, mean, and beautiful machines, with some of fittest athletes on the planet battling fearlessly at speeds excessive of 300 kmph over 20 exotic locations. _Forza Ferrari!_

### Football
I love watching and playing _the beautiful game_. Come rain or shine, my heart beats for Real Madrid. I also root for Liverpool, Juventus, and Portugal. My idol is, you guessed it, Cristiano Ronaldo --- one of the greatest footballers of all time.

## Books
If I had to pick one ~~thing~~ of the few things (Sports comes first) I could do all my life, it would be reading. With 3 fat bookshelves overflowing with books back home, and thousands more in my handy Kindle, there are actually times when I am happy to see long queues, presenting another opportunity to dive into my latest book.

## Music
Beats. Bass. Boisterous. Be it working or working out, music is my constant companion.  Imagine Dragons, Linkin Park, The Script, Zedd, Alan Walker, Bastille, Fall Out Boy, Green Day rule the playlist of this renowned bathroom singer. I also tune into old classics once in a while. I wish to make my own remixes someday.

## Age of Empires
I grew up building many civilisations and plotting the downfall of others, all the while learning so much about the intriguing medieval history. With countless hours spent on AoE2's gripping storyline and exciting gameplay, I can't wait for [AOE4](https://www.ageofempires.com/games/age-of-empires-iv/) to come out!

## Photography and Traveling
I love visiting and documenting quaint, spectacular places; meeting local people; digging into the native cuisine. You can find some of my photos [here](https://www.flickr.com/photos/120844874@N04/). I also love trekking and hiking into the wilderness. After skydiving, scuba diving, and parasailing, I'm looking forward to hang gliding and bungee jumping!
