      <h1>On the latest Tesla crash and an interesting revelation.</h1>

      <hr>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>So there was <a href="https://twitter.com/CC_Firefighters/status/955529991319560192">another Tesla-crash</a> this week. Into a big, red, stationary fire-truck. What?! How can state-of-the-art autonomous driving technology not avoid something as obviously blatant as that?!  <br />
Someone dug into Tesla’s manual to find this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Traffic-Aware Cruise Control cannot detect all objects and may not brake/decelerate for stationary vehicles, especially in situations when you are driving over 50 mph (80 km/h) and a vehicle you are following moves out of your driving path and a stationary vehicle or object is in front of you instead.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now this clearly sounds like a glaring flaw, the kind of an obvious, horrible mistake that engineers should be racing to eliminate. No, how are we even allowing such systems to be deployed on our roads?   <br />
The answer is - without this ‘ignorance’, RADARs wouldn’t work at all. According to <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/tesla-autopilot-why-crash-radar/">this WIRED article</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>…it also detects lots of things a car rolling down the highway needn’t worry about, like overhead highway signs, loose hubcaps, or speed limit signs. So engineers make a choice, telling the car to ignore these things and keep its eyes on the other cars on the road: They program the system to focus on the stuff that’s moving.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you ask me, I don’t understand why sensor-fusion isn’t working here - why aren’t the RGB and depth cameras able to see an approaching (stationary or otherwise) big, red firetruck and veto the RADAR inputs into applying brakes? <br />
Oh well, while we fix the sensor-fusion (and their weightages<sup>1</sup>), we’re stuck with a flawed system, the result of a compromise made to navigate the world at speed. And when even the best systems available can’t see a big red big firetruck, it’s a stark reminder of how long and winding the path to autonomy actually is.</p>
