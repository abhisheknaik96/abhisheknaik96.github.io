# [Research](#research)

I study how the mind works and how intelligent systems learn to perform a myriad of tasks over their lifetime. In other words, I think about intelligence – the computational ability to achieve goals – and how the mind can be modeled as a machine. I believe making progress in answering these questions will benefit humanity significantly and tangibly, for good (in expectation).

## [Projects](#projects)

Here are some selected projects I have done over the past few years.

### Multi-Agent DRiving Simulator (**MADRaS**)
- July 2017 – Apr 2018

Developed the first open-source, fully-controllable multi-agent driving simulator on top of the popular research testbed TORCS, in order to aid multi-agent research in the autonomous driving domain.

### Driving in Traffic with Deep Reinforcement Learning
- Jan 2017 – May 2017

[[Report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2H1r2jYCB02dkZKeW1yQWVILWM/view?usp=sharing)] Used a Deep Learning model to detect and predict features from the on-board dashcam of a car, and trained a Reinforcement Learning model to make driving decisions to successfully [drive in traffic](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL64VfM4ZEjDvlALjskRm0g4Tfay14_I2r).

### Finding the Salient Object in a Visual Scene
- Jan 2017 – May 2017

Implemented Boolean Map Saliency for fast detection of the salient objects in a scene. Consistently matched the performances of Deep Learning techniques over various metrics.

### An AI smarter than an 8th Grader
- Aug 2016 – Nov 2016

Built a question-answering system for 8th-grade multiple-choice science questions, which demonstrated a reasonable level of logical reasoning.

### Light Field Photography
- Aug 2016 – Nov 2016

Captured the 4D light field from a scene and implemented features like refocusing after the photograph has been taken, looking 'behind' objects. Check it out [**here**](LFI)!

### Vehicle Counter and Segregator

Built a prototype for the institute gate using computer-vision techniques to categorize and keep and count of the flowing traffic in dynamic lighting conditions.
