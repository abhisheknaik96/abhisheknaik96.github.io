I"Ø<p>So I just finished reading this book: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3018307-alex-me">â€œAlex and Meâ€, by Irene Pepperberg</a>. It was an insightful read, to say the least. Hereâ€™s what I learned.</p>

<p>For the longest time, â€˜birdbrainâ€™ has been used as a pejorative. Turns out, Grey parrots â€” non-primate, non-mammalian creatures with brains the size of a shelled walnut â€” have cognitive and linguistic skills on par with those of large-brained mammalian chimps and 5-year old human toddlers. Huh.</p>

<p>What could Alex, the particular bird in question, do?
What could Alex do?</p>
<ul>
  <li>Label objects and colours</li>
  <li>Had a functional use of â€˜noâ€™.</li>
  <li>Could add, at least upto six with 85%+ accuracy</li>
  <li>Understood the concept of zero, or none.
    <ul>
      <li>E.g., â€œWhat color five? None.â€ â€” this was Alexâ€™s answer to which coloured quantity is five in number.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Understood that color and shape were categories and not simply labels by themselves and hence could answer â€˜what colorâ€™ and â€˜what shapeâ€™</li>
  <li>Performed lexical elision: put two different words together to form a new word.
    <ul>
      <li>E.g., called an apple â€˜banerryâ€™ â€” tastes like a banana (to Alex) + looks like a cherry</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Understood what he was saying, i.e., seemed to have the ability to comprehend
    <ul>
      <li>If he said â€˜want grapeâ€™ and you gave him a banana, he would spit it out and repeat the request. If any child did this, you would readily agree that they really wanted a grape and not a banana, right?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Would get bored and fool around â€” suggestive of sophisticated cognitive processes
    <ul>
      <li>When presented a silver object, he would say names of all the colours he knew except the correct color â€” statistically highly unlikely.</li>
      <li>When asked how many objects when there two, he went â€˜One four one fourâ€™ â€¦ when put back in his cage as a punishment â€¦ â€˜two, two, Iâ€™m sorry, come here!â€™</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Was entitled and expected people to follow his orders.
    <ul>
      <li>Would not pull a string up to get food, would order someone to get it for him. Other Greys who didnâ€™t have as good a command of labels and requesting would pull up the string themselves.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Watch Alex in action in this cool <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yGOgs_UlEc">YouTube clip</a>!</p>

<p>Dr Pepperberg, the scientist conducting these studies, says that over time, defenders of the â€œhumans are uniqueâ€ doctrine have been moving the goalposts of what constitutes intelligent behaviour<sup>^</sup>. Using tools -&gt; making tools -&gt; using language. And now it turns out that a non-primate, non-mammal creature with a walnut-sized brain can learn elements of communication like large-brained mammals.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>We are a part of nature, not apart from nature. The â€™separatenessâ€™ is a dangerous illusion that led us to exploit every aspect of the natural â€” animals, plants, minerals â€” without consequences. We are now facing the consequences.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is also some cool research on how these African Grey parrots <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2229571-african-grey-parrots-are-smart-enough-to-help-a-bird-in-need/">help each other out</a>!</p>
