I"I<h2 id="about-me"><a href="#about-me">About Me</a></h2>

<p>I am a Ph.D. student at the University of Alberta, working with Professor <a href="incompleteideas.net/">Rich Sutton</a> in the Reinforcement Learning and Artificial Intelligence (<a href="http://rlai.ualberta.ca/">RLAI</a>) lab. I want to discover the general principles that underlie goal-seeking behaviour. I study how the mind works and how intelligent systems can learn to perform a myriad of tasks over their lifetime. I believe research progress in these areas will benefit humanity significantly and tangibly, for good.
<!-- Currently, my research focuses on learning and planning methods for continuing (non-episodic) problems. I also love reading about the connections between AI, neuroscience, and cognitive psychology. -->
<!-- I think about intelligence in the context of artificial agents and conduct research in fundamental RL for making it better-suited for solving real-world problems. I hope to make autonomous vehicles a reality in my country, India. --></p>

<!-- I study how the mind works and how intelligent systems learn to perform a myriad of tasks over their lifetime. In other words, I think about intelligence – the computational ability to achieve goals – and how the mind can be modeled as a machine.

<p><em>This thesis was a part of my integrated Bachelor’s + Master’s program in the Dept. of Computer Science and Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology Madras in Chennai, India, supervised by Professor <a href="www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~ravi">Balaraman Ravindran</a>. Presented in <strong>May 2018</strong>.</em></p>

<p>My goal was to contribute in making self-driving cars a reality in my country, India. I modeled this as a multi-agent learning problem in a safety-critical application and:</p>
<ol>
  <li>proposed a risk-averse imitation learning algorithm that had lower tail-end risk w.r.t. the then state-of-the-art,</li>
  <li>trialled a curriculum-based learning approach for multi-agent RoboSoccer, and</li>
  <li>extended the TORCS simulator to release the first open-source driving simulator that supports multi-agent training.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="formula-1">Formula 1</h3>
<p>There’s hardly anything as spectacular as this confluence of science and engineering which gives the world these lean, mean, and beautiful machines, with some of fittest athletes on the planet battling fearlessly at speeds excessive of 300 kmph over 20+ challenging tracks all over the world. <em>Forza Ferrari!</em></p>

<h3 id="ice-hockey">Ice-hockey</h3>
<p>One of the fastest sport in the world, with an exhausting 60 minutes of action (yes, even while watching). The wizardry these athletes pull off <em>while on skates</em> is a delight to watch (shoutout to Connor McDavid! <em>#LetsGoOilers</em>). I am currently <del>learning ice-skating in order to start playing ice-hockey by early 2020!</del> learning to play ice-hockey!</p>

<h3 id="football">Football</h3>
<p>I love watching and playing <em>the beautiful game</em>. Come rain or shine, my heart beats for Real Madrid. I also root for Liverpool, Juventus, and Portugal. My idol is, you guessed it, Cristiano Ronaldo — one of the greatest footballers of all time.</p>

<h3 id="books">Books</h3>
<p>If I had to pick one <del>thing</del> of the few things I could do all my life, it would be reading (sports comes first). With three fat bookshelves overflowing with books back home, and many more in my handy Kindle, there are actually times when I am happy to see long queues, presenting another opportunity to dive into my latest book.</p>

<h3 id="music">Music</h3>
<p>During the pandemic, I have started learning to play the piano. I hope to play my favourite piano piece <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUCI-1vIbUo">Nuvole Bianche</a> by the end of 2020!
<!-- Beats. Bass. Boisterous. Be it working or working out, music is my constant companion.  Imagine Dragons, Linkin Park, The Script, Zedd, Alan Walker, Bastille, Fall Out Boy, Green Day rule the playlist of this renowned bathroom singer. I also tune into old classics once in a while. I wish to make my own remixes someday. --></p>

<!-- ### Age of Empires
I grew up building many civilisations and plotting the downfall of others, all the while learning so much about the intriguing medieval history. With countless hours spent on AoE2's gripping storyline and exciting gameplay, I can't wait for [AOE4](https://www.ageofempires.com/games/age-of-empires-iv/) to come out! -->

<h3 id="photography-and-traveling">Photography and Traveling</h3>
<p>I love visiting and documenting quaint, spectacular places; meeting local people; digging into the native cuisine. You can find some of my photos <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/120844874@N04/">here</a>. I also love trekking and hiking into the wilderness. After skydiving, scuba diving, and parasailing, I’m looking forward to hang gliding and bungee jumping!</p>
