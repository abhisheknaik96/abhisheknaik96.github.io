I"è<p>The short version:
Octopuses<sup>1</sup> are my favourite animals.</p>
<ul>
  <li>They donâ€™t have a central brain like humans, but their decision-making takes place all over their bodies.</li>
  <li>They are quite intelligent â€” they can learn from observations, have a large memory,</li>
  <li>Many animals can change colors, but the speed and the range of colors, patterns, moving shapes that the octopuses can produce are unmatched</li>
  <li>And they camouflage into these zillions of colors on the ocean floor with just one photoreceptor. One. Humans have three photoreceptors to perceive all the colors we do. Dogs are partially red-green(?) color-blind because they just have two photoreceptors. Octopuses have one. We still donâ€™t know how they do it, but Iâ€™m going to detail one prevalent theory.</li>
</ul>

<p>![Another picture]</p>

<p>Our nearest common ancestor with octopuses is the simple worm-like creature about 600 million years ago. That is so far in the past that we have almost evolved independently.

<p>This independent evolution over 600 million years into our current forms has of course resulted in significant differences, such as octopus bodies not having a single hard component â€” their soft jelly-like bodies can slither from one side of a wall to another through a tiny hole a fraction of their size. More interestingly, their nervous system is unlike anything we see in vertebrates. For instance, in humans, less than 1% of our total neurons are outside the brain, in the spinal chord<sup>2</sup>. In octopuses, however, roughly 80% of their total neurons are outside their central brain, scattered all over their bodies. This is where the brain-body distinction starts getting blurry. Each of their eight arms/tentacles have has some degree of autonomy â€” a delegation of control. (Makes me wonder how they solve the credit-assignment problemâ€¦)

<p>Apart from massive variations in anatomy, there exist peculiar similarities as well. For example, octopuses and humans have independently evolved a camera eye, in which images are focussed on to a retina by a lens. Letâ€™s talk about perception.</p>

<p>Things they can do:</p>
<ul>
  <li>learning from observation</li>
  <li>memory</li>
  <li>complex cognitive tasks</li>
  <li>camouflage</li>
</ul>

<p>Thereâ€™s a lot of things they can do, but I want to talk about camouflage.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Lifespan: about 2 years. Seems such a shame â€” all that learning, didnâ€™t really get to put it to much use.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cephalopods are skilled color changers. Some degree of color change is common in nature, but what makes cephalopods stand apart is the speed and the range of colors. And these are not just fixed patterns, but moving shapes, stripes.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>No wonder they are considered as natureâ€™s parallel experiment in evolving intelligent creatures.
Needless to say, the octopus is now my favourite animal.</p>
