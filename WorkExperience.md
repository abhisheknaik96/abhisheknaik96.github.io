# [Teaching Experience](#teachingExperience)

## Reinforcement Learning (CS6700)
**Jan 2018 - May 2018; Dept. of CSE, IIT Madras**

- As the Head Teaching Assistant of this course taken by [Professor Balaraman Ravindran](www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~ravi), I created and evaluated tutorials, programming assignments, and exams for a class of about 90 undergraduates and postgraduates.


## Principles of Machine Learning (CS4011)
**Aug 2017 - Nov 2017; Dept. of CSE, IIT Madras**

- As one of Teaching Assistants of this course taken by [Professor Balaraman Ravindran](www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~ravi) and [Professor Mitesh Khapra](https://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~miteshk), I created and evaluated tutorials, programming assignments, and quizzes for a class of about 90 undergraduates.

# [Work Experience](#workExperience)

## Huawei Research
**Research Internship; May 2019 – Sep 2019; Edmonton, Canada** <br>
With [Hengshuai Yao](https://hengshuaiyao.github.io/).

- Worked on establishing an appropriate problem formulation for control in continuing tasks with function approximation.
- Surveyed the literature on the average reward problem formulation for MDPs, and its connection with reinforcement learning.
- [Some of the work](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.02140) done here will be presented at the NeurIPS 2019 Workshop on Optimization Foundations of Reinforcement Learning ([OPTRL 2019](https://optrl2019.github.io/)).

## Intel Labs
**Research Internship; May 2017 – Jul 2017; Bengaluru, India** <br>
With [Bharat Kaul](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bharatkaul/)

- Developed a multi-agent version of the TORCS driving simulator compatible with Gym, OpenAI’s RL toolkit.
- Proposed and implemented a novel risk-averse imitation learning framework, achieving upto 89% improvement over the state-of-the-art in terms of tail-end risk at several physics-based control tasks.
-  [This project](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06658) was presented at [AAMAS 2018](http://celweb.vuse.vanderbilt.edu/aamas18/).

## Purdue University
**Research Internship; May 2016 – Jul 2016; Indiana, USA** <br>
With [Bruno Ribeiro](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/ribeirob/)

- Modeled and empirically observed a bi-modal distribution of user-lifespan in a social network.
- Engineered temporal features from the ‘comment’ interactions to design a binary probabilistic classifier to categorise the expected lifespan of new users based on their initial activity.
- Created and curated one of the richest social-media datasets and released it for public use via [a technical paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.03401).

## Amazon Development Centre
**Technical Internship; May 2015 – Jul 2015; Chennai, India** <br>
With [Sravan Bodapati](https://www.linkedin.com/in/justsravan/) and [Venkatraman Kalyanapasupathy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/venkatraman-kalyanapasupathy-b19201/)

- Worked on the design and implementation of a machine learning classifier to determine the relevance of a text-block with a bunch of other text-blocks, in a book.
- The project, now in production, helps Kindle users to directly start reading a book after downloading it, without having to flip through a lot of irrelevant pages.
